# bbcfdc
bbcfdc - Floppy disk raw flux capture and processor

bbcfdc is intended for capturing raw **.rfi** flux data from floppy disk and optionally converting it into a **.ssd**, **.dsd**, **.fsd**, **.td0**, **.adf**, **.st** or a generic **.img** file.

It is designed to work with floppy disk interface PCB attached to GPIO of Raspberry Pi 2 or Raspberry Pi 3 running at 400Mhz (not overclocked), it also works with Raspberry Pi 4 running at 500Mhz (not overclocked). With some modifications the PCB and sample code can be made to work with the Raspberry Pi 1 running at 250Mhz.

Raw flux output is to **.rfi** files, these are raw capture data with JSON metadata, the format for these is detailed in [rfi.h](https://github.com/picosonic/bbc-fdc/blob/master/tools/rfi.h).

Also flux output to **.scp** ([SuperCard Pro](https://www.cbmstuff.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=52)) and **.dfi** ([DiscFerret](https://github.com/discferret) flux dump) is possible (not fully tested).

By default, sectors are sorted by their physical position on the disk regardless of which of the passes the data was found. The **-sort** option allows them to be sorted logically by their sector id. This only affects sectors in **.td0** and **.fsd** files.

## Syntax :

`[-i input_file] [-c] [[-ss [0|1]]|[-ds]] [-o output_file] [-spidiv spi_divider] [-r retries] [-sort] [-summary] [-l] [-sectors sectors_per_track] [-csv] [-tmax maxtracks] [-rpm rpm] [-dblstep] [-title "Title"] [-pll [period] [phase]] [-v]`

## Where :

 * `-i` Specify input **.rfi**, **.scp**, **.hfe**, **.a2r** or **.woz** file (when not being run on RPi hardware)
 * `-c` Catalogue the disk contents (DFS/ADFS/DOS/APPLEII/AMIGA/ATARI ST only)
 * `-ss` Force single-sided capture - optionally adding a 0 or 1 afterwards chooses that side (e.g. `-ss 0` or `-ss 1`)
 * `-ds` Force double-sided capture (unless output is to .ssd or .sdd)
 * `-o` Specify output file, with one of the following extensions (.rfi, .dfi, .scp, .ssd, .sdd, .dsd, .ddd, .fsd, .td0, .img, .adf, .st)
 * `-spidiv` Specify SPI clock divider to adjust sample rate (one of 16,32,64)
 * `-r` Specify number of retries per track when less than expected sectors are found (not when outputting to .rfi, .dfi, .scp or .raw)
 * `-sort` Sort sectors in diskstore by logical sector prior to writing image
 * `-summary` Present a summary of operations once complete
 * `-l` Show a layout diagram of where sectors were found upon the disk surface for each track/side
 * `-sectors` Expected sector count (e.g. 16 for Solidisk / Watford double density DFS)
 * `-csv` Create a csv of bad sectors (named as <outputfile>.csv)
 * `-tmax` Specify the maximum track number you wish to try stepping to
 * `-rpm` Override the drive RPM value instead of measuring it
 * `-dblstep` Force double-stepping, for 40 track disks in 80 track drives
 * `-title` Override the title used in metadata for disk formats which support it (.td0 / .fsd)
 * `-pll` Use PLL to decode flux data. Optionally specify period and phase adjustments (as percentages)
 * `-v` Verbose

## Return codes :

 * `0` - Success
 * `1` - Error with command line arguments
 * `2` - Error not enough permissions
 * `3` - Error allocating memory
 * `4` - Error failed hardware initialisation
 * `5` - Error failed to detect drive

## Requirements :
 
 * bcm2835 library, available from [http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/)

*NOTE : For bcm2835 library to work on Raspberry Pi 4 you should get the latest version*

# drivetest
drivetest - Floppy disk drive testing tool

drivetest is intended for testing basic PCB interface hardware functionality before doing capture.

It will check if the drive and disk are detected, check if read head is at track zero, determine if the disk is write-protected and calculate an approximate RPM.

If you have a broken index sensor, a hard sectored disk or you want to run some tests without requiring a floppy to be inserted then you can specify `-noindex`.

Optionally it can count the number of tracks which can be stepped to by the hardware.

Finally, you can move the drive head in or out by seeking to a specific track.

## Syntax :

`[-tmax maxtracks] [-noindex] [-seek track] [-clean]`

## Where :

 * `-tmax` Specify the maximum track number you wish to try stepping to
 * `-noindex` Don't measure RPM and allow some tests to be carried out without a floppy
 * `-seek` Specify the track number you wish to step to (zero based)
 * `-clean` Start cleaning cycle, ignore index, seek from track 0 to max and back 5 times

## Return codes :

 * `0` - Success
 * `1` - Error failed hardware initialisation, or not enough user permissions
 * `2` - Error failed to detect drive
 * `3` - Error failed to detect disk in drive

# checka2r

checka2r - Check the contents of a **.a2r** (Applesauce) file for debug purposes

checka2r will validate the a2r magic identifier against a2r format version 1 and 2, the binary marker and LFCRLF, to make sure it hasn't been transferred in ASCII mode. It will then traverse the file reading each chunk and displaying details about that chunk. The INFO block is decoded into a human readable form, and the META chunk is displayed in full. Supported chunks are INFO, META, STRM, RWCP and SLVD.

## Syntax :

`[input_a2r_file]`

## Return codes :

 * `0` - Success
 * `1` - Error with command line arguments
 * `2` - Error opening a2r file
 * `3` - Error validating header
 * `4` - Error during chunk processing

# checkfsd

checkfsd - Check the contents of a **.fsd** file for debug purposes

checkfsd is intended for looking at the contents of **.fsd** files, its primary use is for debugging to make sure the file has been written correctly.

It will check for the fsd magic identifier, show the creation details (date stamp, creator, release and the unused data), show the title, number of tracks then iterate through the available tracks printing out the track and sector information. The sector data will be shown (with non-printable characters replaced by ".").

# checkwoz

checkwoz - Check the contents of a **.woz** (Applesauce) file for debug purposes

checkwoz will validate the woz magic identifier against woz format version 1 and 2, the binary marker and LFCRLF, to make sure it hasn't been transferred in ASCII mode, then validate the CRC32 checksum of the file. It will then traverse the file reading each chunk and displaying details about that chunk. The INFO block is decoded into a human readable form, and the META chunk is displayed in full. Supported chunks are INFO, META, TMAP, TRKS, FLUX and WRIT.

## Syntax :

`[input_woz_file]`

## Return codes :

 * `0` - Success
 * `1` - Error with command line arguments
 * `2` - Error opening woz file
 * `3` - Error validating header
 * `4` - Error during chunk processing

## BBC Micro DFS Notes :

 * Using an `.sdd` or `.ddd` output file for BBC DFS disks will assume 16 sectors per track (i.e. double density)
 * Above can be overriden with the `-sectors` switch e.g. `-sectors 18`
 * Disks with different densities on different sides cannot currently be captured into `.ddd`
 * If a Solidisk chained catalogue is detected, it will notify during the catalogue operaton but not list it
